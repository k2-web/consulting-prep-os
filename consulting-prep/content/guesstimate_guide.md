# Guesstimate Guide

**Goal**: Estimate a number you don't know using logic and assumptions.

## Core Strategy: The Tree

Break the problem down into a tree of variables.

**Example**: "How many diapers are sold in the US per year?"

1. **Population**: Start with US Population (~330M).
2. **Segmentation**: Who wears diapers?
    * Babies (0-3 years): ~4M births/year * 3 years = 12M babies.
    * Seniors (80+): ~10M seniors (assumption).
3. **Usage Rate**:
    * Babies: 5/day * 365 days = ~1,800/year.
    * Seniors: 1/day * 365 days = ~365/year.
4. **Math**:
    * Babies: 12M * 1,800 = 21.6B
    * Seniors: 10M * 365 = 3.65B
    * **Total**: ~25B diapers/year.

> [!TIP]
> Round your numbers! Use 300M or 330M for US population, not 331,449,281. The interviewer cares about your *logic*, not your calculator skills.
