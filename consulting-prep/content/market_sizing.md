# Mastering the Market Sizing Framework

Market sizing questions (often called "guesstimates") are a staple of consulting interviews at firms like McKinsey, BCG, and Bain. They test your ability to structure an ambiguous problem, make reasonable assumptions, and perform mental math under pressure.

## What is Market Sizing?

Market sizing is the process of estimating the size of a specific market (e.g., "How many diapers are sold in the US each year?" or "What is the annual revenue of coffee shops in New York City?").

**The Goal:** The interviewer doesn't care about the *exact* answer. They care about your **logic**, **structure**, and **communication**.

## The Core Framework: 4 Steps to Success

### 1. Clarify & Scope

Before you start calculating, ensure you understand the question.

* **Metric:** Are we calculating *Revenue* ($) or *Volume* (# of units)?
* **Timeframe:** Annual, monthly, or daily?
* **Geography:** US only, Global, or a specific city?
* **Constraint:** Residential vs. Commercial?

### 2. Structure Your Approach

Choose a method and explain it to the interviewer *before* you start math.

* **Top-Down:** Start with a large population and filter down.
  * *Best for:* Consumer goods (e.g., toothpaste, smartphones).
  * *Example:* US Population -> % who use smartphones -> Replacement rate -> Total sold.

* **Bottom-Up:** Start with a single unit and scale up.
  * *Best for:* Niche markets or supply-side constraints (e.g., revenue of a specific restaurant).
  * *Example:* Seats in restaurant -> Turns per hour -> Hours open -> Avg ticket price.

### 3. Estimate & Calculate

Make assumptions based on logic or general knowledge. **Use round numbers** to make math easier (e.g., use 330M for US population, not 331.9M).

* **US Population:** ~330 Million
* **Life Expectancy:** ~80 years
* **Persons per Household:** ~2.5
* **Households in US:** ~130 Million

*Tip: Write down every step. If you get stuck, the interviewer can help if they see your work.*

### 4. Sanity Check & Synthesize

Once you have a number, pause. Does it make sense?

* *Check:* "50 billion diapers seems high... oh, I multiplied by days instead of years."
* *Conclude:* State the final number clearly and offer one insight (e.g., "This market is likely saturated, so growth would come from premiumization.").

## Example: "How many mattresses are sold in the US each year?"

**Step 1: Structure (Top-Down)**

* US Population -> Households -> Mattresses per Household -> Replacement Rate.

**Step 2: Assumptions**

* **Population:** 330M.
* **Household Size:** 2.5 people/household -> 330M / 2.5 = **132M Households**.
* **Mattresses/Home:** Avg home has 3 bedrooms (Master, Kids, Guest). Let's say **3 mattresses/home**.
  * Total Installed Base = 132M * 3 = **~400M Mattresses**.
* **Replacement Rate:** People keep mattresses for ~10 years.
  * Annual Sales = Total Base / Replacement Rate.

**Step 3: Calculation**

* 400M / 10 years = **40M Mattresses sold/year**.

**Step 4: Sanity Check**

* 40M / 330M people = ~12%. So roughly 1 in 8 people buy a mattress this year. Seems reasonable.

## Pro Tips for McKinsey, BCG, & Bain

* **McKinsey:** Often embeds sizing into a larger strategy case. Be ready to use your number for a follow-up calculation (e.g., "If we capture 10% share, what's our revenue?").
* **BCG:** Values "MECE" (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) segmentation. Don't double count!
* **Bain:** Focus on the "So What?". Is this market attractive? Should we enter?

> **Practice Drill:** Try estimating the daily revenue of your local coffee shop using a Bottom-Up approach.
