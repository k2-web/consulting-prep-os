# Profitability Framework

**Core Equation**: `Profit = Revenue - Cost`

When a client is facing declining profits, always start by isolating the driver.

## 1. Revenue Analysis

* **Price**:
  * Elasticity: Can we raise prices without losing too much volume?
  * Differentiation: Can we charge a premium for better features?
* **Volume**:
  * **Market Share**: Are we losing to competitors? (Competitor Analysis)
  * **Market Growth**: Is the whole pie shrinking? (Industry Trends)
  * **Product Mix**: Are we selling more low-margin products?
  * **Channels**: Are sales down in retail vs online?

## 2. Cost Analysis

* **Fixed Costs**:
  * Rent, Overhead, Salaries, Depreciation.
  * *Strategy*: Spread over more units (Economies of Scale).
* **Variable Costs**:
  * Raw Materials, Labor, Shipping, Commissions.
  * *Strategy*: Negotiate with suppliers, optimize supply chain.

## 3. Cost Cutting Strategies

1. **Labor**: Reduce overtime, automate tasks, headcount reduction (last resort).
2. **Production**: Lean manufacturing, reduce waste.
3. **Finance**: Refinance debt to lower interest payments.

> [!TIP]
> Always ask for a breakdown of the numbers. "Declining profits" is too vague. "Declining profits in the North American division due to rising labor costs" is a solvable problem.
