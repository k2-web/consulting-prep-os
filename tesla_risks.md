# Tesla (TSLA) - Top 3 Risk Factors

Based on the latest 10-K filings (2024) and subsequent 10-Q updates (2025), the following are the three most significant risks facing Tesla:

## 1. Intense Competition in the EV Market
Tesla operates in an increasingly crowded and competitive automotive market. Both established legacy automakers and new EV entrants are aggressively expanding their electric vehicle portfolios. This intensifying competition exerts pressure on Tesla's market share, pricing power, and margins. To maintain its leadership position, Tesla must continue to innovate and manage costs effectively, but there is no guarantee it can sustain its competitive advantage indefinitely.

## 2. Supply Chain Constraints and Disruptions
Tesla's operations are highly dependent on a complex global supply chain. The company is vulnerable to disruptions caused by geopolitical events, natural disasters, and shortages of critical components, most notably battery cells and semiconductors. Any inability to secure necessary parts at competitive prices or on time can severely impact production schedules, delivery targets, and overall profitability.

## 3. Regulatory and Legal Challenges
The company faces significant regulatory scrutiny and legal risks. This includes evolving environmental regulations, safety standards (particularly regarding Autopilot and FSD features), and ongoing legal proceedings. Notably, the legal battle surrounding CEO Elon Musk's 2018 performance award and potential compensation revisions poses a material financial and governance risk. Non-compliance or adverse legal outcomes could result in substantial fines, operational restrictions, or reputational damage.
